# Introduction (OFF PAGE & WIP)
Hello! I am __Skye, Selan or Mioh__, any works __if related to my name__. Any prns are allowed, I don't really mind, __refrain me from getting called as meow/cat__ though, __any of these things__ which I don't fucking understand that they have these kinds of genders vro, it's not even considered as a gender gng. I mean, it does adds up to your persona, but it isn't really considered to be as __"gender"__, if you get what I mean though. I am way focused in real life. I no longer use dc but I still play pony town but rarely. I'm trying to have a better life style and away from social medias.


__Goal: 3yrs__ of working out + learning mandarin chinese to communicate with my homies :3
